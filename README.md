# VSWS
“Vulnerability Scanner for Web Services (VSWS)”  is an automated web service scanner which scans the web services (Rest & GraphQL) for vulnerabilities. While scanning the Rest API and GraphQL API test site, one of the first step is to import the resource URLs into the scanner. Another important step is to provide the documentation or log which show the behavior of the web services. VSWS can be used to test and report SQL/XML/NOSQL injection, spoofing, Denial of services (DOS), Command injection, Missing server-side input validation, unwanted use of HTTP method, and header injection. After scanning it will show list of vulnerabilities, their report/detail and suggest required safety measures.
